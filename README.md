Dear Full Sail,
===============

The Problem
-------------
Over the course of my studies at Full Sail University's Web Design & Development program I've noticed many instructors' frustration with the delay between the time students are required to write critiques of their courses and the time when they can finally receive thoses critiques and act on them.

Many of them end up asking their students directly for feedback and ideas to improve specific courses and the degree as a whole but those thoughts are often unorganized. Furthermore, it's difficult for a single teacher to keep track of all student suggestions and weigh them against all the previous ones they receive. 

There is also a risk of receiver bias since the more eloquent and well-spoken students are often more likely to have less issues regarding the program than shy students who have a hard time expressing what confuses them or what they wish would be different about the degree.

The Solution
-------------
Polling a sufficient proportion of Full Sail WDD students would allow instructors and program managers to get a better sense of what makes student tick, and not only months down the line. 

Being a web focused degree, a web app seems like a much more efficient medium than sheets of scantron-like papers requiring tedious data-entry (something any business, let alone Full Sail, should have abandoned years ago). It also means asking students to use a medium they are familiar with to express their opinions.

This will surely increase the noise-to-signal ratio since the internets are hardly known for the tameness of their flames, but if we can verify students' identities (using their school-provided email accounts) we can at least limit the onslaught of trolls by not revelling in absolute anonymity. 

I'm still undecided as to whether I want to display the full names of the registered students on the site or keep it private to make sure nothing they say can be held against them on campus. I'm a fervent believer in freedom of speech but that freedom includes the duty to be accountable for the thoughts one expresses, so I'll remain on the fence until decisive arguments are thrown at me.

The Implementation
-------------------
In effect it will be very similar to Hacker News and Reddit in the sense that pressing issues will need to be "voted up" by students. A certain ratio (to be determined during testing) of votes per student per period (day/week/month) will be established to make sure students make their votes count. It will also push students to make sure they agree fully with the propositions they decide to support.

To start, the platform will be limited to the WDDBS program but I fully intend to extend it school-wide if it proves successful and useful.
